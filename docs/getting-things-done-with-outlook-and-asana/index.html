			<p>Nowadays, much of incoming (reactive) work arrives through email. In this post I want to share an approach I found efficient for myself to manage that work, in addition to proactive work. The process below builds on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> time management method and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">Eisenhower</a> method for setting priorities.</p>
<p><img src="/images/getting-things-done-with-outlook-and-asana-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the regular state of my Outlook inbox (except some outliers here and there of course ðŸ˜Š). I usually do one of the following actions when processing inbox, and then archive the email immediately:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I estimate the task to be relatively short (up to 30 minutes), I work on it and reply</li>
<li>In case I need help with the task, I delegate immediately</li>
<li>Otherwise, I send the email to Asana using Outlook for Windows <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-quick-steps-b184f89f-3738-4562-96de-c0244ea830f2">Quick Steps</a> feature.</li>
</ol>
<p>The quickstep is configured to forward the email to <code>x@mail.asana.com</code> address. Asana creates a task from that email and assigns it to me. I add the task to a specific project, <strong>always</strong> set a due date, and move to &ldquo;Today&rdquo;, &ldquo;Upcoming&rdquo; or &ldquo;Later&rdquo; sections.</p>
<p>Since I work with external customers as well, I have two Outlook folders: &ldquo;Corporate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Customers&rdquo; (otherwise I would have only &ldquo;Corporate&rdquo; or &ldquo;Archive&rdquo;). To find something, I use Outlook&rsquo;s search instead of (over)organizing everything in multiple folders. For example, when I need to follow up on an email when done with a task in Asana, I just search for the task subject in Outlook (because the subject is the task name in Asana).</p>
<p>Asana&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Tasks&rdquo; view is the only one that I use on a daily basis, across all projects. &ldquo;Today&rdquo;, &ldquo;Upcoming&rdquo; and &ldquo;Later&rdquo; sections serve as priorities, in that order. If the task is about an incoming request, I set the due date to the same day when I received the inquiry - this helps me add time sensitivity when prioritizing tasks. If the task is a follow-up, reminder, or something proactive, I set due date to the desired completion date and move it to &ldquo;Today&rdquo;, &ldquo;Upcoming&rdquo; or &ldquo;Later&rdquo; section according to priority. Asana has a neat feature for tasks to move automatically from &ldquo;Later&rdquo; to &ldquo;Upcoming&rdquo; section a week before the due date, and from &ldquo;Upcoming&rdquo; to &ldquo;Today&rdquo; on the due date itself. This essentially doesn&rsquo;t require me to go back to the backlog and move things around manually, it just &ldquo;comes back to me&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/images/getting-things-done-with-outlook-and-asana-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Asana&rsquo;s <a href="https://asana.com/guide/help/api/calendar-sync#gl-outlook">Sync to Outlook</a> feature allows me to view tasks based on their due dates in Outlook. It helps me a lot when planning meetings or other activities. I also have the &ldquo;My Tasks&rdquo; tab open at all times for prioritization, marking tasks as complete and picking up the next one.</p>
<p><img src="/images/getting-things-done-with-outlook-and-asana-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I want to move multiple due dates around, I find Asana&rsquo;s calendar view to make my planning and adjustments easier (list view doesn&rsquo;t provide the same kind of time orientation as calendar does). I use the &ldquo;My Tasks&rdquo; calendar view to drag and drop tasks to change their due date. Clicking on a task will open a modal view, where I can use keyboard shortcuts for moving it to the appropriate section (e.g. &ldquo;Later&rdquo;).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all, folks :)</p>
